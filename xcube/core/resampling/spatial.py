    Resample a dataset in the spatial dimensions.

    If the source grid mapping *source_gm* is not given,
    it is derived from *dataset*:
    ``source_gm = GridMapping.from_dataset(dataset)``.

    If the target grid mapping *target_gm* is not given,
    it is derived from *source_gm*:
    ``target_gm = source_gm.to_regular()``.

    If *source_gm* is almost equal to *target_gm*, this
    function is a no-op and *dataset* is returned unchanged.

    Otherwise the function computes a spatially
    resampled version of *dataset* and returns it.

    Using *var_configs*, the resampling of individual
    variables can be configured. If given, *var_configs*
    must be a mapping from variable names to configuration
    dictionaries which can have the following properties:

    * ``spline_order`` (int) - The order of spline polynomials
        used for interpolating. It is used for upsampling only.
        Possible values are 0 to 5.
        Default is 1 (bi-linear) for floating point variables,
        and 0 (= nearest neighbor) for integer and bool variables.
    * ``aggregator`` (str) - An optional aggregating
        function. It is used for downsampling only.
        Examples are numpy.nanmean, numpy.nanmin, numpy.nanmax.
        Default is numpy.nanmean for floating point variables,
        and None (= nearest neighbor) for integer and bool variables.
    * ``recover_nan`` (bool) - whether a special algorithm
        shall be used that is able to recover values that would
        otherwise yield NaN during resampling.
        Default is True for floating point variables,
        and False for integer and bool variables.

    Note that *var_configs* is only used if the resampling involves
    an affine transformation. This is true if the CRS of
    *source_gm* and CRS of *target_gm* are equal and one of two
    cases is given:

    1. *source_gm* is regular.
       In this case the resampling is the affine transformation.
       and the result is returned directly.
    2. *source_gm* is not regular and has a lower resolution
       than *target_cm*.
       In this case *dataset* is downsampled first using an affine
       transformation. Then the result is rectified.

    In all other cases, no affine transformation is applied and
    the resampling is a direct rectification.
